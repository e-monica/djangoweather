In this project, I began by initialized the environment for a local hosted page provided by django. 

Once fully booted, I formatted simple HTML and CSS build into my home page. 

With basic formatting stable, I used http://docs.airnowapi.org/ for our Weather API json pull. 

In doing so, I further formatted the information to default show my zipcode's Air Quality Index levels. 
With some python, I built into the search zipcode box the capability for accessing different cities' Air Quality Indices via the same API.
Some much fun, really enjoyed it. And if you can run it, it's very useful yet simply in interface for both coding complexity and its subsequent provided info. 
Thanks for reading
